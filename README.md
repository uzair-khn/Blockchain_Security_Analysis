# Blockchain Security Analysis
## Description:

The analysis involve the examination of the Blockchain Smart Contract to find any vulnerabilities/weakness or any risk that could compromise the security related to the smart contracts. <br/>
The analysis will be static analysis like it will be done before deployment of any smart contract. <br/>
I use the online platform for this project named Remix IDE.

## What is needed for the project: 

- Choose any blockchain platform like Remix ID, Hyperledger Fabric, or EOS. I choose:
  <br/> ***Remix IDE i.e. Ethereum blockchain*** : Link <a>https://remix.ethereum.org/</a> 
- Plugins : Solidity Static Analysis & MythX Security Verification

## Working Steps
- Open Remix IDE which will look this,<br/><br/>

   Create a folder in the IDE with whatever name you like. Mine by, **my_contracts**<br/>
   ‚û°Ô∏èüñ±Ô∏è Folder and add file named ***Smart_contract1.sol*** <br/><br/>
